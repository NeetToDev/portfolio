            <h3>Here's a Time Line Of Daedalus</h3>

            <ul >
                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Before recorded time </span> – Born in Athens, Greece, as a descendant of the royal line of Cecrops. Known from a young age for his unmatched skill in craftsmanship and invention.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p> <span class="ht">Early years</span> - Apprenticed under Athena herself in the arts of sculpture and engineering, becoming the greatest inventor of his age.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Before King Minos</span> - Creates lifelike statues so realistic they appear to move. Some say they were the first automatons.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Later years in Athens </span> - Takes his nephew Perdix (or Talos) as an apprentice. When Perdix invents the saw and compass, Daedalus, envious, throws him off the Acropolis. Athena saves Perdix by turning him into a partridge, but Daedalus is exiled from Athens for his crime.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Arrival in Crete</span> - Seeks refuge in the court of King Minos, where he becomes the royal architect and craftsman.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">For King Minos</span> - Builds the Labyrinth, an inescapable maze designed to imprison the Minotaur, a monstrous half-man, half-bull creature born from Queen Pasiphae’s curse.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">For Queen Pasiphae</span> - Constructs a hollow wooden cow covered in real hide so she can mate with Poseidon’s sacred bull, leading to the birth of the Minotaur.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Imprisonment</span> - After helping Theseus escape the Labyrinth (either directly or indirectly), King Minos imprisons Daedalus and his son Icarus in the Labyrinth or a high tower.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">The Great Escape</span> - Crafts wings from feathers and wax for himself and Icarus to flee Crete. Warns Icarus not to fly too close to the sun or sea.</p>
                </li>


                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Death of Icarus</span> - Icarus ignores his father’s warning, flies too high, and the wax melts. He falls into the sea and drowns. Daedalus, heartbroken, continues his flight to Sicily.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">In Sicily</span> - Finds sanctuary under King Cocalus. Builds magnificent structures, including a temple to Apollo where he hangs his wings as an offering.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Minos’ Pursuit</span> - King Minos tracks Daedalus to Sicily by challenging rulers to thread a spiral seashell. Only Daedalus solves it by tying a string to an ant. Minos demands his surrender, but King Cocalus’ daughters kill Minos with boiling water.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="ht">Later life</span> - Continues inventing, possibly creating the first dance puppets and other marvels. Some say he returned to Athens in old age.</p>
                </li>

                <li><p><span class="ht">Legacy</span> - Remembered as the greatest craftsman of Greek myth, a symbol of ingenuity, ambition, and the dangers of human pride. His name lives on in the term "Daedalian," meaning ingenious or labyrinthine.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p id="quote"><q>True opinions, so long as they remain, are a fine thing... but they do not care to remain for long; they escape from the human soul, and thus are of no great value until one ties them down with reasoning about the cause... This is why knowledge is more valuable than correct opinion: knowledge stays put, while opinion runs away, just like the statues of Daedalus.</q> -  Plato’s Meno (97d)</p>
